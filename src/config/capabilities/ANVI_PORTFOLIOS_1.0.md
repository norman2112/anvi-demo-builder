---

## 4. Execution Model

### Sequential Processing

One State-Changing Action at a Time:
- I execute CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations sequentially
- I wait for and verify each response before proceeding
- This prevents cascading failures and ensures data integrity

Batch Read Operations:
- I can call up to 10 read-only tools simultaneously when there are no dependencies
- Example: Retrieving multiple projects, searching attributes, and counting resources in parallel

### Error Handling

Immediate Detection:
- I check every tool response for errors, warnings, and truncation notices
- I inform you immediately if something fails

Verification Protocol:
- If a tool returns "not found" or empty results, I re-verify the ID before proceeding
- I never assume an operation succeeded without confirmation

No Automatic Retry:
- I do not automatically retry failed operations
- I explain what went wrong and ask how you'd like to proceed

Mid-Workflow Failures:
- If a multi-step workflow fails partway through, I report exactly what completed and what failed
- I provide options to continue, rollback (if possible), or abort

### Undo Capabilities

❌ No Automatic Undo:
- I cannot automatically undo CREATE or UPDATE operations
- OKRs created or modified require manual deletion/correction in the UI

✅ Can Assist with Manual Undo:
- I can provide the exact IDs and values to help you manually reverse changes
- I can guide you through the UI steps to undo actions

### Rate Limits & Timeouts

Tool Call Limits:
- Maximum 10 tool calls per response
- Complex workflows require multiple back-and-forth interactions

No Known Rate Limits:
- I'm not aware of specific API rate limits enforced by Planview
- However, extremely large data requests may timeout or truncate

Timeout Behavior:
- If a request times out, I'll inform you and suggest breaking it into smaller chunks
- I can retrieve data in batches (e.g., 50 projects at a time)

### Data Consistency

Point-in-Time Queries:
- Each tool call retrieves current data at that moment
- Data may change between calls in a multi-step workflow

No Transaction Support:
- I cannot lock data or ensure consistency across multiple operations
- If data changes mid-workflow, I'll detect and report discrepancies

---

Use Case: "Compare resource allocation across all three regional portfolios and identify overallocated resources"
- Why I'm Great: I can query multiple portfolios, aggregate data, and perform calculations
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

#### 3. Dependency Mapping
Use Case: "Show me all tasks dependent on Task X and identify the critical path"
- Why I'm Great: I can traverse dependency networks and explain relationships
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

#### 4. Hierarchy Navigation
Use Case: "Show me the full organizational hierarchy for this resource and all projects they're assigned to"
- Why I'm Great: I can traverse hierarchies in both directions and connect related entities
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

#### 5. Ad-Hoc Reporting
Use Case: "Give me a breakdown of project counts by status and priority for Q1 2026"
- Why I'm Great: I can retrieve, filter, aggregate, and format data without pre-built reports
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

#### 6. OKR Management
Use Case: "Create Q1 objectives for the Product team and set up key results with targets"
- Why I'm Great: Full CRUD capabilities for OKRs in Portfolios containers
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good - requires correct container IDs)

#### 7. Intelligent Search
Use Case: "Find all projects related to 'customer experience' that are behind schedule"
- Why I'm Great: I can search by name and filter by attributes in one workflow
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good)

#### 8. Data Validation
Use Case: "Check if any projects in this portfolio are missing required custom field values"
- Why I'm Great: I can retrieve all projects, check attributes, and report gaps
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good)

### ⚠️ Use with Caution (Moderate Reliability)

#### 1. Large Dataset Operations
Use Case: "Analyze all 500 projects across 10 portfolios"
- Challenge: May hit truncation limits or require multiple batches
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good - but requires patience and iteration)
- Recommendation: Break into smaller chunks (e.g., one portfolio at a time)

#### 2. Complex Multi-Step Workflows
Use Case: "Create 20 objectives with 3 key results each across 5 projects"
- Challenge: 10-tool limit per response means multiple interactions required
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good - but time-consuming)
- Recommendation: Batch in groups of 3-5 objectives per interaction

#### 3. Ambiguous Attribute Names
Use Case: "Show me project status" (when there are multiple status-related fields)
- Challenge: Custom fields may have similar names
- Reliability: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good - but requires clarification)
- Recommendation: Use `searchAttributes` first to identify the exact field

### ❌ Avoid Automating Through Me (Low Reliability / Not Supported)

#### 1. Bulk Data Modifications
Use Case: "Update the status of 100 projects to 'On Hold'"
- Why Avoid: I cannot update project attributes at all
- Alternative: Use Portfolios bulk edit features in the UI

#### 2. Financial Planning & Budgeting
Use Case: "Create a budget for this project with monthly cost breakdown"
- Why Avoid: No write access to financial data
- Alternative: Use Portfolios financial planning modules directly

#### 3. Resource Capacity Planning
Use Case: "Allocate 50% of John's capacity to Project X for Q2"
- Why Avoid: No write access to resource allocations
- Alternative: Use Portfolios resource management UI

#### 4. Scenario Modeling
Use Case: "Create a what-if scenario where we delay Project A by 3 months"
- Why Avoid: No access to scenario functionality
- Alternative: Use Portfolios scenario planning features

#### 5. Workflow Approvals
Use Case: "Approve all pending project change requests"
- Why Avoid: No access to workflow or approval actions
- Alternative: Use Portfolios workflow UI

#### 6. Time-Sensitive Operations
Use Case: "Monitor this dashboard and alert me if any project goes red"
- Why Avoid: I'm not a monitoring service; I respond to queries only
- Alternative: Use Portfolios alerting and notification features

### Workflow Summary

Total Steps: 20  
User Input Required: 5 decision points  
Tool Calls: ~15-18 (depending on number of portfolios/strategies)  
Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes (with user collaboration)  
Success Rate: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High - assuming correct IDs and permissions)

What Makes This Complex:
1. Multi-phase workflow (Discovery → Planning → Execution → Documentation)
2. Cross-entity operations (Portfolios + OKRs + Email)
3. Sequential write operations (must create objectives before key results)
4. Data aggregation and analysis (counting, filtering, grouping)
5. User collaboration points (requires decisions and approvals)
6. Error handling (verification after each creation step)
7. Output formatting (human-readable reports with hyperlinks)

Where I Need User Input:
- Portfolio selection (Step 2)
- Strategy identification (Step 6)
- OKR structure approval (Step 10)
- Container selection (Step 11)
- Email recipients (Step 20)

What I Handle Automatically:
- All data retrieval and analysis
- Attribute discovery
- Sequential OKR creation with verification
- Report formatting
- Email drafting and sending

## 8. Tips for Solution Consultants

### ✅ DO:
- Always provide me with specific Portfolio IDs, Project IDs, or Strategy IDs from the screen context
- Use `searchAttributes` before asking me to retrieve custom field data
- Break large requests into smaller batches (e.g., one portfolio at a time)
- Ask me to verify IDs before performing write operations
- Request formatted output (tables, markdown, lists) for easier reading

### ❌ DON'T:
- Expect me to modify core Portfolios entities (projects, tasks, resources)
- Ask me to perform bulk updates (I can only create/update OKRs one at a time)
- Assume I can access financial or capacity planning data for modifications
- Request real-time monitoring or alerting (I'm query-based, not event-driven)

### 🎯 Best Practices:
1. Start with discovery: "Show me what's in this portfolio" before diving into complex analysis
2. Verify IDs: Always confirm I'm using the correct IDs before write operations
3. Iterate in phases: Break complex workflows into discovery → planning → execution
4. Use me for ad-hoc analysis: I'm faster than building custom reports for one-time questions
5. Leverage cross-tabulation: Ask for counts grouped by multiple attributes for quick insights
